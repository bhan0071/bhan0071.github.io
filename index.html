        <p><em>Hello there!</em> How are ya? My name is <q>Akashdeep singh</q> but you can call me Akash...
        I am originally from <em>india.</em> The country where all your favourite coffee come from <strong>Mostly.</strong>
        I came to Canada a few months ago, and as every single immigrant I didn't know the language: I struggled and battled my way out,
        I used several strategies to improve my <q>language skills...</q> I'm also a musical person, what do I mean by that? Ever sinceI was a child
        I played several instruments: I've been loving music since forever, when I came out of my mom's womb I was basically playing instruments already.</p>

        <p>What else can I say about me...? My first language is in fact <q><em>punjabi.</em></q> Aside from that I speak Englsih <strong>obviously,</strong> and then I also speak a little bit of french, I became a huge fan of languages ever since I came to Canada. Several things 
        people would not know about me is that I play chess with my grandpa sometimes, and... I used to go through an artist phase, I used to do wonderful drawings about anything that came in mind.</p>
